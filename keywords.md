# Week 1: Project Keywords

## Project: Telecommunications

This document lists five key concepts related to the project, with detailed explanations.

---

### 1. Machine Learning
Machine learning refers to a set of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.  
In this project, machine learning models are applied to analyze large datasets of network traffic and predict future patterns.

### 2. Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting involves analyzing data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals to predict future values.  
This is crucial for telecommunications, as network usage varies over time and accurate forecasting helps in resource planning and optimization.

### 3. LSTM Neural Network
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn long-term dependencies in sequential data.  
They are particularly effective for time-series prediction in this project, such as forecasting call or internet usage patterns over days or weeks.

### 4. Urban Data Analysis
Urban data analysis focuses on extracting insights from data related to city activities, such as mobile calls, messages, or internet usage in different areas.  
This helps in understanding population behavior, high-traffic zones, and trends in telecommunications usage in urban environments.

### 5. Prediction Error
Prediction error measures how far the predicted values deviate from the actual observed values.  
Common metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Evaluating prediction error is essential to assess model performance and improve accuracy.
