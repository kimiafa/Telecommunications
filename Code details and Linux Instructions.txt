List of python files and their functions (In the 'Source Code' folder) :

1. networktraffic.py: Converts each text file into a dataframe and save it as a pickle file
2. extractInformation.py : Generates a dictionary of area code vs total traffic over 2 months

4. task1c.py: Displays the plots of the time series traffic intensities over the first 14 day period
5. task2a.py: Prepares the training set for the 3 areas
6. task2b.py: Compiles and trains a common neural network for all 3 areas
7. task2c.py: Performs predictions on the pre-built model and displays the predicted plots

List of required dictionaries ((In the 'Input Data' folder) :

1. areaModelDic  : Tuples containing the area code and its corresponding trained model
2. areaTrafficDic: Tuples containing the area code and its corresponding 2 month total traffic intensity

Instructions to run the prediction algorithm on Linux:

1. Make sure the following files are present in the same folder : 
a. areaModelDic.npy
b. task2c.py
c. trafficmodel_4159.h5
d. trafficmodel_5161.h5
e. trafficmodel_4556.h5
f. list4159_test.npy
g. list4556_test.npy
h. list5161_test.npy

2. Run the following line of code: python task2c.py <Area code>, where <Area code> can be replaced by either of the following: 4159,4556 or 5161. 
(Entering an invalid code leads to an error message).

3. The output must contain the printed MAE and MAPE, as well as the original and predicted plots saved in the format 'Original_<Area code>.png' and 
   'Predicted_<Area code>.png'.
